This dataset was derived from a 7T fMRI study of N=90 healthy human adults (18-40 years old, M=26.9 years old, SD=6.2 years; 40 females). Participants completed one T1-weighted structural scan and three ten-minute resting-state functional scans. Raw structural and functional scan data are available here.
